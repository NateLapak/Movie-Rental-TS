## Origins
One of three winners for the Macewan Computer Science club - Hackathon 2022

Created by Nathan Lapak, Andrew Numrich, Ayesha Khan and Fahad Ali.

Project is a movie rental web application. Unfortunately, we never got to finish so some features are missing.
The bug occurs when you hover over a movie's thumbnail and it plays the trailer for that movie.
Run npm start to run the website

## About
This project uses NextJS and TailwindCSS to make a movie rental system web application. This is a continuation of the hackathon project and is basically the hackathon project with all the implements that we set out to finish. The theme: "It's not a bug, it's a feature" has been removed as well.
The project has been deployed to Vercel but is not finished. Check it out with the link below.
