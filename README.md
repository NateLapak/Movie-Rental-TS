## Origins
One of three winners for the Macewan Computer Science club - Hackathon 2022

Created by Nathan Lapak, Andrew Numrich, Ayesha Khan and Fahad Ali.

Project is a movie rental web application. Unfortunately, we never got to finish so some features are missing.
The bug occurs when you hover over a movie's thumbnail and it plays the trailer for that movie.
Run npm start to run the website
